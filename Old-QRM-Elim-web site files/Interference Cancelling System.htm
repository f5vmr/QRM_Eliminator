<P><u><B>INTRODUCTION</B></u></P>
<P>The use of interference signal cancellation has been around for some time. 
  The idea is to use an auxiliary antenna (almost any random length of wire) in 
  addition to the main receiving antenna. As the two antennas are physically spaced 
  from each other and also unlikely to have similar field patterns, the amplitude 
  and phase difference between the two antennas for an interfering signal can 
  be expected to be different to that for the desired signal. This particularly 
  applies to a localised interference source where that source is largely coupled 
  into the antenna by induction. This induction field follows a different law 
  of signal attenuation verses distance to that of the radiation field by which 
  the distant desired signal is being received. The two antenna outputs are combined 
  after modifying their relative signal levels and phase such that the interference 
  signal from one antenna is equal but opposite in phase to that from the other 
  antenna. The interference signal is cancelled but as the two desired signals 
  have a different amplitude and phase relationship, a resultant desired signal 
  component is retained. Of course for all this to work. the interference waveform 
  must be continuous and reasonably stable in its shape and amplitude. From my 
  own experience. the system works extremely well for power line noise and frequency 
  dependent noise bars generated by TV line time base and computers.</P>
</FONT>
<p>To achieve this form of interference cancellation, some device is required 
  which can adjust the amplitude and phase of one or both of the antenna signals. 
  Relative phase between the two signals must be adjustable over a 360 degree 
  range to cope with different signal conditions. In 1976, Drew Diamond VK3XU 
  submitted articles on a passive method of mixing and adjusting the two antenna 
  signals. To provide 180 degrees phase shift, Drew provided a reversing switch 
  in the main antenna circuit. A matching network consisting of a tapped inductor 
  and two variable capacitors was connected to the auxiliary antenna. Further 
  adjustment of phase was achieved by detuning the matching network. Amplitude 
  was adjusted by a potentiometer in each antenna circuit. The idea of a passive 
  unit, as Drew had used, seemed attractive in that there were no transistors 
  to encourage cross modulation and of course no power required apart from relay 
  control. On the other hand, I questioned whether detuning an antenna matching 
  network was adequate to give the complete range of phase shift which might be 
  required.</p>
<p>Phil Williams VK5NN drew our attention to a unit called a QRM Eliminator distributed 
  by a British company SEM. Phil owns one of these units and has reported very 
  favourably on its ability to balance out unwanted signal. The SEM unit is an 
  active device powered from 12VDC and is provided with phase and amplitude adjustment 
  controls. Their Mark 1 unit is switchable between amateur HF bands but a later 
  Mark 2 unit has broadband inputs with no front end tuning and continuous coverage 
  without switching. Phase shift control is achieved with resistance-capacity 
  networks for phase shift control..</p>
<p>With all this background, I decided that I should attempt a circuit design 
  of my own. At that time I had no idea what form of phase control circuitry SEM 
  might have used and I first built the noise cancel unit using my own arrangement 
  of resistance-capacity phase shift networks ( reference 1). I tuned the front 
  input rather than use a broadband circuit which I feared could suffer from interference 
  due to cross modulation from out of band strong signals.</p>
<p>I thought my first design was a bit complicated and I eventually came up with 
  a different idea to achieve the phase shift in a new cancelling unit which is 
  described in this article.</p>
<p><br>
  In principle, phase adjustment is very simple. If a signal is loosely coupled 
  into a parallel tuned circuit, the phase produced across the tuned circuit can 
  be easily shifted over a 90 degrees range as the circuit is tuned, from part 
  way down one side of the resonance curve, through resonance, to part way down 
  the other side. The effect can easily be demonstrated by loosely coupling a 
  signal generator into a tuned circuit and simultaneously monitoring, with a 
  dual trace CRO, the signal generator output and the signal across the tuned 
  circuit. The precise amount of phase shift for a given frequency offset can 
  be derived from the curves (figure 1) reproduced from Terman.</p>

  <P align="left"><font face="3Darial">To achieve 180 degrees of phase shift, 
    we use two identical tuned circuits with their tuning capacitors ganged together. 
    The two tuned circuits must be loosely coupled or separated by an amplifier 
    isolating stage. The 90 degrees shift in the second circuit is additive to 
    that in the first circuit giving us a 180 degrees of range. Of course the 
    amplitude also varies across the resonance curve. In practice, this is no 
    problem as the phase and amplitude controls have to be progressively adjusted, 
    in turn a number of times, until the interference null is achieved.</font></P>
  <p align="left">For the circuit detail, refer to figure 2. In this diagram, 
    L1-C1A and L2-C1B are the two tuned circuits coupled by resistor R2. Inductors 
    L1 and L2 are identical and capacitors C1A and C1B are a ganged variable pair. 
    In practice, tracking of tuning does not appear to be critical and hence there 
    is no need to be too concerned about precision matching of the inductors. 
    The circuit, as shown, runs with a fairly low Q and almost any identical pair 
    of inductors can be used provided they are selected with the right inductance 
    for the frequency concerned. Matched aerial and RF coils from an old valve 
    receiver can be put to good use here. In this case, the primary winding of 
    the aerial coil can be used to couple the auxiliary antenna instead of using 
    coupling resistor R1.</p>

    <P align="left"><font face="3Darial">Inductors specified in figure 2 (and 
      figure 3) are miniature RF chokes which can be purchased from electronic 
      stores for about one dollar each. These are very convenient because they 
      are no larger than a resistor or small capacitor, can be supplied in precise 
      values of inductance and save the effort of having to wind the coils. The 
      inductance value (10 uH) shown in figure 2 allows tuning between the 3.5 
      and 7 MHz bands. The resonant tuning range is greater than this but a tuning 
      overlap must be allowed for phase adjustment either side of resonance at 
      the extreme ends of 3.5 and 7 MHz. For 1.8 to 3.5 MHz we can use 39uH, for 
      7 to 14MHz - 2.7uH and for 14 to 28MHz - 0.68uH. If complete HF band coverage 
      is required, a 4 pole 2 position switch can be used as shown in figure 3.</font></P>

      <P align="left"><font face="3Darial">Two transistor stages follow the phase 
        shift tuning system. FET stage V1 provides high input resistance to prevent 
        loading of the tuned circuits and provides voltage gain which is needed 
        in reserve in the system. Emitter follower stage V2 provides a low source 
        resistance to drive the receiver input via the mixing circuit. Potentiometer 
        RV1 is used to set amplitude in adjusting for interference null. The potentiometer 
        must be a non inductive type (not wire wound) with a preferred tapered 
        resistance characteristic to improve adjustment resolution when set near 
        minimum. If a tapered pot is not available and difficulty is experienced 
        in adjusting near minimum setting, the gain of the amplifier can be reduced 
        by reducing the value of resistor R3 or providing a switch to connect 
        in a lower value. The final component in the phase control chain is switch 
        SW1. This reverses the phase of the auxiliary signal to extend the 180 
        degrees of phase adjustment to 360 degrees.</font></P>
      <p align="left">The signal from the auxiliary circuit is combined with that 
        from the main antenna via transformer T2 which, with its associated circuitry, 
        prevents interaction between the two signal sources. Readers with a Telecom 
        background might recognise T2 circuit as similar to the Hybrid Coil circuit 
        used to achieve two way amplification on single pair telephone trunk lines.</p>
      <p align="left">For the isolation to work, the receiver is assumed to present 
        a 50 ohm resistive load. Added to this is series resistor R8 (nominally 
        50 ohms) making a total of 100 ohms which is balanced against 100 ohms 
        resistor R7. The main antenna is loaded by these two 100 ohm circuits 
        in parallel, hence 50 ohms load is presented to the main antenna. As the 
        lower two windings of T2 are in antiphase, the inductance of T1 in series 
        with the main antenna is cancelled out. Furthermore, no signal from the 
        main antenna can be induced into the upper winding of T1 which is connected 
        to the auxiliary output.</p>
      <p align="left">As far as the auxiliary circuit is concerned, its signal 
        is induced into the lower two windings of T1 which are connected across 
        the two 100 ohm circuits in series, that is, 200 ohms. As there is a 1:1 
        turns ratio, 200 ohms is reflected back to the auxiliary output circuit. 
        Whilst half the auxiliary output power is fed to the receiver input, the 
        auxiliary output voltage to earth is virtually zero at T2 centre tap. 
        As this is the main-antenna connection, auxiliary output signal is prevented 
        from reaching the main antenna. Of course, the usual 50 ohms input to 
        the receiver is a nominal value and the degree of isolation between the 
        two circuits depends on how near the receiver input circuit is to a resistance 
        of that value.</p>

      <P align="left"><font face="3Darial">For the DX listener, figure 2 in conjunction 
        with figure 3 makes up a complete system. However for amateur radio use, 
        extra circuitry is required to switch out and provide protection for the 
        interference cancelling unit when transmitting. Relay A is operated on 
        transmit by normal contacts of the TX/RX relay in the transceiver. On 
        transmit, relay contacts A2 and A3 switch out the balancing and mixing 
        transformer and connect the transceiver direct to the main antenna. Relay 
        contacts A1 disconnect the auxiliary antenna and earth the auxiliary input. 
        Diodes across the interference cancelling input and output circuits provide 
        additional surge protection.</font></P>

        <P align="left"><font face="3Darial">To balance out an unwanted signal 
          or noise, first advance the amplitude control to a suitable level and 
          set the phase control for maximum signal or noise (i.e. circuits L1-C1a 
          and L2-C1b are near resonance). Then set for a balance by adjusting 
          the phase and amplitude controls for lowest noise or interference, one 
          after the other a number of times, until an interference null is achieved. 
          If a null is not found, or the null is not very definite, the phase 
          is reversed with the reversing switch and the procedure repeated.</font></P>
        <p align="left">In my first unit, a tuned input from the auxiliary antenna 
          was found to be necessary to prevent cross modulation from local broadcast 
          stations and other signals which caused 'birdies'. In the new unit, 
          the input tuning system combines this function with phase control. Whilst 
          the tuning might be set a little off resonance, it still provides rejection 
          of out of band signals.</p>

        <P align="left"><font face="3Darial">The load resistance placed on T1 
          by the receiver is built out to 100 ohms by resistor R8. This attenuates 
          the signal to the receiver a little when the cancelling unit is switched 
          in. In my own unit, I decided to eliminate this and I later replaced 
          R8 with a matching transformer T2 as shown in figure 5. I then experienced 
          some instability in stage V2. (Sometimes emitter follower stages tend 
          to become unstable if fed directly into a reactive load). To tame this, 
          a new R8 (47 ohms) was connected in series with C5.</font></P>
